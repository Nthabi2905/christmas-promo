## 🧠 Key Features

- 🎨 **SVG-based design** — crisp and scalable graphics at any resolution.
- 💫 **No JavaScript required** — purely HTML + CSS.
- 🌍 **Responsive layout** — uses relative sizing (`width="100%"`, `height="100%"`) for scaling on various screen sizes.
- 🧩 **Customizable** — easy to tweak colors, add animations, or include additional decorations.
- 🌲 **Layered tree design** — realistic tree built from multiple `path` and `clipPath` layers.
